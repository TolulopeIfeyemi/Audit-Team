Token Standards in Blockchain.

Token standards acts as the blueprints for creating and managing tokens within a specific 
ecosystem. They define a set of rules and protocols that dictate how tokens are created, 
transferred, interacted with, and behave within the network. This ensures consistency, 
compatibility, and ease of integration across different applications and platforms.

Some of the most popular token standards:

1. Ethereum Token Standards (ERC):

- ERC-20: ERC-20 governs fungible tokens, meaning each token is identical and interchangeable. 
It's the most widely used standard, enabling seamless integration with exchanges, wallets, 
and decentralized applications (dApps) within the Ethereum ecosystem.

- ERC-721: This standard defines non-fungible tokens (NFTs), each unique and irreplaceable. 
It has revolutionized digital ownership, paving the way for collectibles, art, 
and in-game items on the blockchain.

- ERC-777: Building on ERC-20, ERC-777 introduces additional features like operator functionality 
and improved security with "hooks" for enhanced control over transfers.

- ERC-1155: A multi-token standard, ERC-1155 allows developers to bundle various fungible and 
non-fungible tokens within a single smart contract, increasing efficiency and reducing gas costs.


2. Binance Smart Chain Standards (BEP):

- BEP-20: The BEP-20 standard is directly analogous to ERC-20, enabling fungible token creation and 
interaction on the Binance Smart Chain. It offers faster transaction speeds and lower fees 
compared to Ethereum.

-BEP-721:** This standard mirrors ERC-721 for NFTs on the Binance Smart Chain.


3. Other notable standards:

- Tezos FA2: A versatile standard on the Tezos blockchain, supporting both fungible and 
non-fungible tokens with enhanced security and upgradeability features.

- Hyperledger Fabric Tokenization Services: Designed for enterprise blockchains, this standard 
facilitates the issuance and management of tokens with customizable permissions and workflows.
